# Ceaser-Encryptor Decryptot
This is a simple python based ceaser encryptor and decryptor, which encrypts data taken from a user in the form of alphabets, and executes it using Ceaser cipher algorithm.
The user also has the option to decide how many rounds the shuffling will take place, the user has to choose a number from 1 to 25 to do that.
The GUI of the program was created using the Tkinter module, and the algorithm runs in Python 3.7.
The user can also decrypt the encrypted line of words, given they have the original encrypted text and the key which was originally used to do the shuffling.
